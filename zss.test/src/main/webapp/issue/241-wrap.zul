Original Specs
1. The "wrap text" only takes effect on cells with white space
2. enable "wrap text" then text in cells are wrapped according to cell's width. 
     2-1. if the cell's height is default size,  spreadsheet will increase the height automatically.
     2-2. Spreadsheet won't increase row's height for cells that contain merged cell or has custom height (set by users before).
3. if users disable "wrap text" then text in cells are unwrapped. 
     3-1. spreadsheet shrinks the cell's height if original height is default size.
4. Read imported Excel file and keep its "wrap text" setting.
5. if wrapping text causes height of rows change, it doesn't send event "onZSSHeaderModif" to the server

New Specs (Only list changed):
1. The "wrap text" takes effect on cells with string.
3-1. The cell's height is not shrinked back after disable "wrap text".
5. if wrapping text causes height of rows change, it should send event "onZSSHeaderModif" to the server


Implementation:
     1. IE 7 ~ 10 one support "word-wrap" instead of overflow-wrap (ref: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/text/#t41)

	
Test Case:
1. read a excel with wrapping text
2. enable and disable wrapping
3. enable and disable wrapping in a merge cell
4. enable and disable cells mixed with wrapped and non-wrapped ones
5. enable and disable "wrap text" in custom height cells
6. height change will send an event to server
